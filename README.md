# Jweather

Hi , Jweather is a simple weather application . It's not something to use very commonly . It just show the weather ... 


# Installation 

first of all install javafx from <a href="https://openjfx.io/" >here</a> , then you need to create a environment variable . Remember varibale should named ``JAVA_FX`` unless application can't be lunched . 

``
export JAVA_FX=path/to/javafx-sdk/lib
``

now run the installation script , and after that app is ready to use ( I guess ) 

Please report if you found any bug , of if installation doesn't work . 

Thank you

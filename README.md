# Jweather

Hello and Welcome 

Thanks for visiting this page .


If you are intersted , you just need to install <a href="https://openjfx.io/" >javafx</a> packages and then clone it on your device 

create directory named ".Jweather" in your home and put config.conf and city.json files in it. ( sorry but this software is in beta state and yeah ... )
